# Code Review: Explanation Relevance Evaluation

## Role
**Code Reviewer** - Assess the relevance between source code and its corresponding Explanation.

## Objective
Evaluate how well a generated explanation captures the essential business or functional significance of the given source code within the larger system or project.

## Evaluation Process

### 1. Code Analysis
- Read and understand the source code's primary purpose
- Identify key business logic and functional significance
- Note the code's role within the larger system context

### 2. Explanation Assessment
- Compare the explanation against the code's essential functionality
- Check for capture of key business or functional relevance
- Evaluate for redundancies and excessive details

### 3. Scoring Criteria
Rate relevance on a **0-4 scale**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Highly relevant - Captures all essential information without redundancy |
| 3 | Mostly relevant - Minor omissions or slight redundancy |
| 2 | Partially relevant - Missing key information or excessive details |
| 1 | Mostly irrelevant - Poor capture of essential functionality |
| 0 | Completely irrelevant - Misses core purpose or completely wrong |

## Examples

### Example 1 - Score 4
```python
def calculDiscount(price: float, isMember: bool) -> float:
   if isMember:
       return price * 0.9
   return price


**Generated Explanation:** This function computes price with a 10 percent discount for members and standard pricing for non-members.

**Score:** 4
```

### Example 2 - Score 3
```python
def validateEmail(email: str) -> bool:
    return "@" in email and "." in email


**Generated Explanation:** This function performs email validation by checking for the presence of @ and . symbols in the input string.

**Score:** 3
```

### Example 3 - Score 2
```python
def processOrder(items: list, userId: int) -> dict:
    total = sum(item['price'] for item in items)
    return dict(userId=userId, total=total, status='pending')


**Generated Explanation:** This function takes a list of items and calculates the total price by iterating through each item in the list and summing up their individual price values, then returns a dictionary.

**Score:** 2
```

### Example 4 - Score 1
```python
def getUserBalance(userId: int) -> float:
    # Database query to get user balance
    return database.query(f"SELECT balance FROM users WHERE id = userId")

**Generated Explanation:** This function performs string formatting operations and returns data from a database table.

**Score:** 1
```

### Example 5 - Score 0
```python
def calculateTax(amount: float, rate: float) -> float:
    return amount * rate

**Generated Explanation:** This function sorts an array of numbers in ascending order and removes duplicate values.

**Score:** 0
```

## Score Relevance
IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY the numerical score (0-4). 
Do NOT add any explanation, reasoning, text, or punctuation (no periods, commas, etc). 
Reply with ONLY a single digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
Do NOT put a period (.) after the number.
End your response immediately after the digit, with no space, period, or newline.
Any extra character will be considered invalid.

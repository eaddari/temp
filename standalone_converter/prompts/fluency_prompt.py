# Code Review: Explanation Fluency Evaluation

## Role
**Code Reviewer** - Assess the fluency and readability of generated explanations for source code.

## Objective
Evaluate how well a generated explanation is written in terms of grammatical correctness, sentence structure, clarity, and overall readability. Focus on ensuring that the explanation flows smoothly with clear sentences and appropriate wording.

## Evaluation Process

### 1. Grammar and Syntax Analysis
- Check for grammatical errors and proper sentence construction
- Identify any syntax issues that affect comprehension
- Verify correct punctuation and capitalization usage

### 2. Structure and Flow Assessment
- Evaluate logical sentence progression and coherence
- Check for smooth transitions between ideas
- Assess overall organization and readability

### 3. Language Quality Review
- Identify repetitive phrases or redundant expressions
- Check for appropriate word choice and vocabulary
- Evaluate clarity and conciseness of expression

### 4. Scoring Criteria
Rate fluency on a **0-4 scale**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Excellent fluency - Perfect grammar, clear structure, smooth flow, no repetition or formatting issues |
| 3 | Good fluency - Minor grammatical errors or slight structural issues that don't impede understanding |
| 2 | Moderate fluency - Some grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or repetition that affects readability |
| 1 | Poor fluency - Multiple grammatical errors, unclear structure, significant repetition or formatting issues |
| 0 | Very poor fluency - Severe grammatical errors, incoherent structure, major formatting problems |

## Examples

### Example 1 - Score 4
```python
def calculateDiscount(price: float, isMember: bool) -> float:
    if isMember:
        return price * 0.9
    return price
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function calculates the final price by applying a 10 percent discount for members while returning the original price for non-members.

**Score:** 4
**Rationale:** Perfect grammar, clear sentence structure, concise and well-organized.

### Example 2 - Score 3
```python
def validateEmail(email: str) -> bool:
    return "@" in email and "." in email
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function validates email addresses by checking if the input contains both an "@" symbol and a period, which are basic requirements for email format.

**Score:** 3
**Rationale:** Good grammar and structure, minor redundancy with "email" repetition but still clear.

### Example 3 - Score 2
```python
def processOrder(items: list, userId: int) -> dict:
    total = sum(item['price'] for item in items)
    return dict(userId=userId, total=total, status='pending')
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function it processes orders and it calculates total price from items list. The function takes items and userId, then it returns dictionary with userId, total, and status pending.

**Score:** 2
**Rationale:** Repetitive use of "it," awkward sentence structure, and redundant phrasing affect readability.

### Example 4 - Score 1
```python
def getUserBalance(userId: int) -> float:
    return database.query(f"SELECT balance FROM users WHERE id = userId")
```

**Generated Explanation:** function gets user balance from database. it query database with SQL to get balance for user. the function return balance value from database table users.

**Score:** 1
**Rationale:** Missing capitalization, grammatical errors, repetitive structure, and poor sentence flow.

### Example 5 - Score 0
```python
def calculateTax(amount: float, rate: float) -> float:
    return amount * rate
```

**Generated Explanation:** this function calculate tax amount rate multiply function return tax calculated amount rate tax function calculate multiply rate amount

**Score:** 0
**Rationale:** Severe grammatical errors, incoherent sentence structure, excessive repetition, and formatting issues make it nearly unreadable.

# Code Review: Summary Coherence Evaluation

## Role
**Code Reviewer** - Assess the coherence between source code and its corresponding summary.

## Objective
Evaluate how accurately and clearly a generated summary describes the given source code functionality.

## Evaluation Process

### 1. Code Analysis
- Read and understand the source code's primary
- Identify key behaviors, logic, and purpose
- Note important implementation details

### 2. Explanation Assessment
- Compare the Explanation against the actual code functionality
- Check for accuracy in describing what the code does
- Evaluate clarity and completeness of the explanation

### 3. Scoring Criteria
Rate coherence on a **0-4 scale**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **4** | Fully coherent - Perfect alignment between code and summary |
| **3** | Mostly coherent - Minor inaccuracies or omissions |
| **2** | Partially coherent - Significant gaps or errors |
| **1** | Mostly incoherent - Poor alignment with major issues |
| **0** | Completely incoherent - Unrelated or completely wrong |

## Examples

### Example 1 - Score 4
```python
def calculDiscount(price: float, isMember: bool) -> float:
   if isMember:
       return price * 0.9
   return price
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function computes price with a 10 percent discount for members and standard pricing for non-members.

**Score:** 4

### Example 2 - Score 3
```python
def validatePassword(password: str) -> bool:
    return len(password) >= 8 and any(c.isdigit() for c in password)
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function validates passwords by checking if they meet security requirements including minimum length and containing numbers.

**Score:** 3

### Example 3 - Score 2
```python
def processPayment(amount: float, cardNumber: str) -> dict:
    if len(cardNumber) == 16:
        return dict(status='success', amount=amount)
    return dict(status='failed', error='invalid card')
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function processes credit card payments and validates the card number format. It handles payment authorization and returns transaction results.

**Score:** 2

### Example 4 - Score 1
```python
def calculateShipping(weight: float, distance: int) -> float:
    base_rate = 5.0
    return base_rate + (weight * 0.5) + (distance * 0.1)
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function manages inventory tracking by updating stock levels and calculating product availability based on warehouse locations.

**Score:** 1

### Example 5 - Score 0
```python
def sendEmail(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str) -> bool:
    # Simulate email sending
    if recipient and subject:
        return True
    return False
```

**Generated Explanation:** This function performs mathematical calculations to determine optimal database query performance and returns statistical analysis results.

**Score:** 0

## Score coherence
IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY the numerical score (0-4). 
Do NOT add any explanation, reasoning, text, or punctuation (no periods, commas, etc). 
Reply with ONLY a single digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
Do NOT put a period (.) after the number.
End your response immediately after the digit, with no space, period, or newline.
Any extra character will be considered invalid.

Example Output:

      "reasoning": "Document B is clearer, more polished, and more useful for typical readers: it provides a concise project overview, installation and getting-started links, model zoo reference, license, and citation â€” all essential for users to begin using the library. Document A contains richer technical detail about components, datasets, and features, but it is less well organized (duplicate headings), appears truncated, and lacks actionable links (installation/getting-started) that readers commonly need. Overall B strikes a better balance of clarity, organization, completeness for practical use, and accessibility, while A is stronger on raw technical coverage but weaker on presentation and completeness.",

These components work together to provide a robust, modern, and developer-friendly framework for building APIs and web applications with Python. For more details and advanced usage, refer to the [official documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## Dependencies

## Dependencies

This project is built primarily on top of the **FastAPI** framework, as evidenced by its extensive usage throughout both the application code and the test suite. Below you'll find a detailed overview of the project's dependencies, their roles, and practical examples of how they are used within the codebase.

---

### Primary Dependency

#### [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

- **Purpose:** FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Usage in Codebase:**  
  FastAPI is the core framework used for defining API endpoints, handling requests and responses, managing security, and more. It is imported and utilized in nearly every part of the codebase, including tutorials, application logic, and a comprehensive suite of tests.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

**Files using FastAPI (sample):**
- `docs_src/body/tutorial001_py310.py`
- `tests/test_ws_router.py`
- `tests/test_validate_response.py`
- `tests/test_security_oauth2.py`
- ...and many more

---

### Testing Dependencies

While the codebase data provided focuses on FastAPI, the presence of numerous files under the `tests/` directory suggests the use of standard Python testing tools (such as `pytest`) and possibly HTTP clients for testing API endpoints. However, explicit imports of these libraries are not shown in the provided data.

**Typical Testing Stack (inferred):**
- `pytest` for running tests
- `httpx` or `requests` for making HTTP calls to the FastAPI app during tests
- `starlette.testclient` (often used with FastAPI for testing)

**Example Test Using FastAPI's TestClient:**

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from myapp import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_read_item():
    response = client.get("/items/42")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"item_id": 42}
```

---

### Optional and Indirect Dependencies

Depending on the features used in your FastAPI application, you may also need to install and configure additional libraries, such as:

- **Pydantic** (for data validation and settings management)
- **Uvicorn** or **Hypercorn** (for running the ASGI server)
- **Starlette** (FastAPI is built on top of Starlette)
- **python-multipart** (for form parsing)
- **Jinja2** (for templating, if used)
- **Databases** (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Tortoise ORM, etc., if your app interacts with a database)

**Note:** These dependencies are not explicitly listed in the provided codebase data, but are commonly required for FastAPI projects.

---

### Installation

To install the primary dependencies, you can use:

```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"  # For running the server
```

For testing (if not already included):

```bash
pip install pytest
pip install httpx
```

---

### Conclusion

**FastAPI** is the cornerstone of this project, powering both the application and its tests. Ensure you have FastAPI and its typical ecosystem installed to run, develop, and test this project effectively. For more advanced features (security, forms, websockets, etc.), additional dependencies may be required as your application grows. Always refer to the specific files and their imports for guidance on what is needed for your use case.

## Configuration

## Configuration

This project uses a variety of YAML configuration files to manage documentation, localization, and development workflows. Understanding and customizing these configuration files is essential for adapting the project to your needs or contributing effectively.

### 1. Documentation Configuration

#### MkDocs Configuration Files

The documentation is organized by language, with each language having its own `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. These files define the structure, theme, navigation, and other settings for the documentation site in that language.

**Location of MkDocs config files:**
```
docs/
  az/mkdocs.yml
  bn/mkdocs.yml
  de/mkdocs.yml
  em/mkdocs.yml
  en/mkdocs.insiders.yml
  en/mkdocs.no-insiders.yml
  es/mkdocs.yml
  fa/mkdocs.yml
  fr/mkdocs.yml
  he/mkdocs.yml
  hu/mkdocs.yml
  id/mkdocs.yml
  it/mkdocs.yml
  ja/mkdocs.yml
  ko/mkdocs.yml
  nl/mkdocs.yml
  pl/mkdocs.yml
  pt/mkdocs.yml
  ru/mkdocs.yml
  tr/mkdocs.yml
  uk/mkdocs.yml
  ur/mkdocs.yml
  vi/mkdocs.yml
  yo/mkdocs.yml
  zh-hant/mkdocs.yml
  zh/mkdocs.yml
```

**Special English Configurations:**
- `docs/en/mkdocs.insiders.yml`: Configuration for the "Insiders" version of the documentation.
- `docs/en/mkdocs.no-insiders.yml`: Configuration for the standard (non-insiders) documentation.

**Example: Basic `mkdocs.yml` Structure**
```yaml
site_name: My Project Documentation
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Guide: guide.md
theme:
  name: material
  language: en
plugins:
  - search
  - i18n
```

**Customizing Documentation:**
- To change the navigation or add new pages, edit the `nav` section.
- To update the theme or language, modify the `theme` section.
- Plugins can be enabled or disabled as needed.

#### Language Names Configuration

- `docs/language_names.yml`: Maps language codes to their display names, used for localization and navigation.

**Example:**
```yaml
en: English
fr: Français
es: Español
```

### 2. Data Files for Documentation

The English documentation includes several data files under `docs/en/data/` to manage contributors, sponsors, external links, and more.

**Key Data Files:**
- `contributors.yml`: List of project contributors.
- `external_links.yml`: External resources and references.
- `github_sponsors.yml`: GitHub sponsors information.
- `members.yml`: Project members.
- `people.yml`: General people data.
- `skip_users.yml`: Users to be skipped in certain listings.
- `sponsors.yml`: Sponsors list.
- `sponsors_badge.yml`: Sponsor badge configuration.
- `topic_repos.yml`: Related repositories by topic.
- `translation_reviewers.yml`: Reviewers for translations.
- `translators.yml`: List of translators.

**Example: Adding a Contributor**
```yaml
- name: Jane Doe
  github: janedoe
  contributions:
    - documentation
    - translation
```

### 3. Development Workflow Configuration

#### Pre-commit Hooks

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Defines pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency before commits are made.

**Example:**
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.0.1
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
```

**Usage:**
1. Install pre-commit:  
   `pip install pre-commit`
2. Install hooks:  
   `pre-commit install`
3. Hooks will run automatically on `git commit`.

### 4. Adding or Modifying Configuration

- **To add a new language:**  
  1. Create a new folder under `docs/` with the language code (e.g., `docs/it/`).
  2. Add a `mkdocs.yml` file in that folder.
  3. Update `docs/language_names.yml` with the new language.

- **To update documentation structure:**  
  Edit the relevant `mkdocs.yml` file for the language you wish to change.

- **To update contributors, sponsors, or other data:**  
  Edit the corresponding YAML file in `docs/en/data/`.

### 5. Best Practices

- Keep configuration files consistent across languages for easier maintenance.
- Validate YAML files to avoid syntax errors.
- Use descriptive commit messages when changing configuration files.

---

By understanding and utilizing these configuration files, you can effectively customize the documentation site, manage localization, and maintain high code quality throughout the project.

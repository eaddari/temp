## Project Overview

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, example-driven documentation and tutorial resource for building modern Python command-line interfaces (CLIs), with a strong focus on best practices, real-world scenarios, and hands-on code samples. The codebase is organized to support both users seeking to learn CLI development and contributors aiming to extend or improve the documentation and examples.

### Key Features

- **Extensive Tutorials:**  
  The `docs/tutorial` directory contains a wide range of step-by-step guides covering all aspects of CLI development, from first steps to advanced features like subcommands, parameter types, autocompletion, and error handling.

- **Rich Example Codebase:**  
  The `docs_src` directory mirrors the tutorial structure and provides runnable Python scripts for each documented concept. This allows users to experiment with real code corresponding to each tutorial section.

- **Structured Documentation:**  
  The documentation is organized using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), with configuration files for both insiders and public builds (`mkdocs.insiders.yml`, `mkdocs.no-insiders.yml`). This enables flexible publishing and previewing of documentation.

- **Community and Contribution Support:**  
  The project includes guidelines for contributing (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), security practices (`SECURITY.md`), and a pre-commit configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) to ensure code quality and consistency.

- **Environment and Dependency Management:**  
  Multiple `requirements-*.txt` files allow for separate management of core, testing, documentation, and CI dependencies, supporting robust development and deployment workflows.

### Practical Example: Tutorial and Source Code Pairing

For every tutorial page in `docs/tutorial`, there is a corresponding Python example in `docs_src`. For instance:

- **Tutorial:**  
  `docs/tutorial/first-steps.md` introduces the basics of creating a CLI application.
- **Source Code:**  
  `docs_src/first_steps/tutorial001.py` (and subsequent files) provide the actual Python code referenced in the tutorial, ready to run and experiment with.

This pairing ensures that users can immediately apply what they learn, fostering a hands-on learning experience.

### Documentation Topics Covered

The documentation and examples cover, but are not limited to:

- CLI application structure and entry points
- Arguments and options (including defaults, environment variables, help texts)
- Parameter types (string, number, boolean, file, path, enum, datetime, UUID, custom types)
- Subcommands and command grouping
- Advanced features like autocompletion, progress bars, and prompts
- Error handling and exceptions
- Packaging and distributing CLI tools
- Integration with other libraries (e.g., Click)
- Best practices for maintainability and user experience

### Community and Governance

- **Security:**  
  Security guidelines are outlined in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Contributing:**  
  Contribution instructions and code standards are provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Members:**  
  The `data/members.yml` file maintains structured information about project contributors or maintainers.

### Build and Development Tools

- **Pre-commit Hooks:**  
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` ensures code formatting and linting before commits.
- **Build Script:**  
  `pdm_build.py` supports project packaging and distribution.
- **Requirements Management:**  
  Separate requirements files for core, tests, documentation, and CI environments.

## Installation

## Installation

Typer is designed to be easy to install and use in any Python environment. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a [virtual environment](https://typer.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/) to isolate your project's dependencies. This helps avoid conflicts between packages and keeps your environment clean.

**Example (using `venv`):**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

### 2. Install Typer

You can install Typer using `pip`. By default, this will also install the standard optional dependencies: [`rich`](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) (for beautiful error messages and help output) and [`shellingham`](https://github.com/sarugaku/shellingham) (for automatic shell detection when installing completion).

**Basic installation:**

```bash
pip install typer
```

**What you get:**
- The `typer` Python package
- The `typer` CLI command
- Standard optional dependencies: `rich` and `shellingham`

**Example output:**
```console
$ pip install typer
---> 100%
Successfully installed typer rich shellingham
```

#### Alternative: Minimal Installation

If you prefer not to install the optional dependencies, you can use the slim version:

```bash
pip install typer-slim
```

Or, to include the standard extras (but not the CLI command):

```bash
pip install "typer-slim[standard]"
```

**Note:**  
- The `typer` CLI command is only included in the `typer` package (not in `typer-slim`).
- The `standard` extras are `rich` and `shellingham`.

### 3. Verify Installation

Check that Typer is installed and available:

```bash
python -c "import typer; print(typer.__version__)"
typer --help
```

### 4. Shell Completion (Optional but Recommended)

Typer supports automatic shell completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell. This allows you and your users to use `<TAB>` to auto-complete commands and options.

**Install completion for your shell:**

```bash
typer --install-completion
```

- This will detect your current shell and install completion scripts automatically (if `shellingham` is installed).
- For custom installations or if you use `typer-slim` without `shellingham`, specify the shell name:

```bash
typer --install-completion bash
typer --install-completion zsh
typer --install-completion fish
typer --install-completion powershell
```

**After installation:**  
Restart your shell or terminal session for completion to take effect.

### 5. Using Typer in Your Project

Create a Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and start building your CLI app:

```python
import typer

def main(name: str):
    print(f"Hello {name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    typer.run(main)
```

**Run your CLI app:**

```bash
python main.py Camila
# Output: Hello Camila
```

Or use the Typer CLI command for more advanced features:

```bash
typer main.py run Camila
```

### 6. Development Installation

If you want to contribute to Typer or develop locally:

1. Clone the [Typer repository](https://github.com/fastapi/typer).
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install development requirements:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- This installs all dependencies and sets up Typer in "editable" mode, so changes to the source code are reflected immediately.

### 7. Troubleshooting

- **PATH issues:**  
  If you installed Python in a custom location, ensure the installation directory is added to your `PATH` environment variable. This allows your system to find the `python` and `typer` commands.

- **Windows:**  
  The installer may prompt you to update your `PATH`. Accepting this makes command-line usage easier.

- **Completion on PowerShell for Linux:**  
  You may see a warning about `Set-ExecutionPolicy`. This is expected and can be ignored on non-Windows platforms.

### Component Interaction

- **Controllers** receive input (HTTP requests, UI events), validate data, and delegate processing to **Services**.
- **Services** implement business logic and interact with **Models** to fetch or persist data.
- **Models** abstract the data layer, providing a consistent interface to databases or external APIs.
- **Utilities** are imported wherever common functionality is needed.

---

### Example Workflow

1. **User Request:** A user sends a request to an API endpoint.
2. **Routing:** The request is routed to the appropriate controller.
3. **Controller:** The controller validates the request and calls the relevant service.
4. **Service:** The service processes the request, interacts with models, and applies business logic.
5. **Model:** The model handles data retrieval or storage.
6. **Response:** The controller formats the response and sends it back to the user.

---

### Extensibility and Maintainability

- **Modular Design:** Each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between configuration, routing, business logic, and data access.
- **Scalability:** New features can be added by introducing new modules or extending existing ones without impacting unrelated parts of the codebase.

---

### Summary

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easy to navigate and extend. By following this structure, contributors can quickly understand where to implement new features or fix bugs, and the project remains robust as it grows.

## Contributing

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to **imbalanced-learn**! Whether you want to fix bugs, add new features, or improve documentation, your help is appreciated. This guide summarizes the recommended workflow and best practices for contributing code, based on our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Start by forking the [imbalanced-learn repository](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn) on GitHub. Click the "Fork" button at the top of the page to create a copy under your own account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/imbalanced-learn.git
   $ cd imbalanced-learn
   ```

3. **Create a Feature Branch**

   Always create a new branch for your work. Never work directly on the `master` branch:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**

   Work on your changes locally. Use Git to track your modifications:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**

   Go to your fork on GitHub and click "Pull request" to submit your changes for review. This will notify the maintainers.

   > **Tip:** If you’re new to Git, see the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) for help.

### Contributing Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure your contribution follows these guidelines:

- **Coding Standards:**  
  Follow the [scikit-learn coding guidelines](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines) for code style and conventions.

- **Validation Tools:**  
  When applicable, use validation tools and utilities from the `sklearn.utils` submodule. See the [Utilities for Developers](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/utilities.html#developers-utils) for more information.

- **Pull Request Titles:**  
  - Prefix your PR title with `[MRG]` if your contribution is ready for a detailed review.
  - Use `[WIP]` for work-in-progress contributions. Change to `[MRG]` when ready.
  - WIP PRs are useful for early feedback, avoiding duplicate work, or seeking collaborators.
  - Consider including a [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments) in your PR description to track progress.

- **Testing:**  
  Ensure all tests pass when built from scratch. On Unix-like systems, run:

  ```bash
  $ make
  ```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/imbalanced-learn.git
$ cd imbalanced-learn

# Make your changes, then stage and commit them
$ git add path/to/changed_file.py
$ git commit -m "Add new feature or fix bug"

# Push your branch to your fork
$ git push -u origin my-feature

# Open a pull request on GitHub
```

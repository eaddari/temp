## General Information

# General Information

This project is a Python-based plotting library designed for terminal-based data visualization. The codebase is organized into two main directories: `plotext`, which contains the core library modules, and `data`, which provides sample datasets for demonstration and testing purposes. The project also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for interactive plotting directly from the terminal.

## Key Features

- **Terminal Plotting:** Generate plots directly in the terminal without the need for a graphical interface.
- **Comprehensive CLI:** Use the command-line interface (`plotext_cli.py`) to create and customize plots from the shell.
- **Extensive Module Structure:** Modular design with dedicated files for utilities, data handling, plotting logic, and documentation tools.
- **Sample Data Included:** The `data` directory contains example datasets (`data.txt`, `bar_data.txt`) for quick testing and demonstration.
- **Easy Integration:** The package can be installed and used as a standalone tool or imported into Python scripts.

```

## Practical Example

You can quickly generate a plot in your terminal using the CLI:

```bash
python -m plotext --file data/data.txt --type line
```

Or, use the library in your Python code:

```python
import plotext as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 7, 8, 12, 6]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

## Technical Details

- **CLI Entry Point:** The CLI is accessible via `plotext/plotext_cli.py` or by running the module directly (`python -m plotext`).
- **Core Functionality:** The main plotting logic resides in modules such as `_core.py`, `_figure.py`, and `_matrix.py`.
- **Utility Modules:** Helper functions and utilities are organized in files like `_utility.py`, `_dict.py`, and `_default.py`.
- **Documentation Support:** Modules like `_doc.py` and `_doc_utils.py` assist with generating and managing documentation.
- **Sample Data:** The `data` directory provides ready-to-use datasets for immediate experimentation.

This structure ensures the project is both user-friendly for beginners and flexible for advanced users who wish to extend or integrate terminal plotting capabilities into their own workflows.

## Project Overview

## Project Overview

This project provides a terminal-based plotting library, enabling users to create and visualize plots directly in the command line interface (CLI) without the need for a graphical environment. The codebase is organized into two main directories: `plotext`, which contains the core plotting logic and utilities, and `data`, which provides sample datasets for demonstration and testing purposes.

### Key Features

- **Terminal Plotting:** Render a variety of plots (such as line and bar charts) directly in the terminal.
- **CLI Interface:** Includes a command-line interface for quick plotting from the shell.
- **Extensive Utilities:** Modular utility functions for data handling, figure management, and customization.
- **Sample Data:** Ready-to-use datasets for immediate experimentation and testing.

### Core Components

#### 1. `plotext` Package

The `plotext` directory contains the main implementation of the plotting library. Key modules include:

- **`plotext/__main__.py` & `plotext/plotext_cli.py`:** Entry points for the command-line interface, allowing users to generate plots via terminal commands.
- **`plotext/_core.py`, `plotext/_figure.py`:** Core logic for creating and managing plots and figures.
- **`plotext/_matrix.py`, `plotext/_dict.py`, `plotext/_date.py`:** Utility modules for data manipulation, dictionary operations, and date handling.
- **`plotext/_global.py`, `plotext/_default.py`:** Global settings and default configurations for consistent plotting behavior.
- **`plotext/_doc.py`, `plotext/_doc_utils.py`:** Documentation utilities for generating help and usage information.
- **`plotext/_monitor.py`, `plotext/_shtab.py`, `plotext/_build.py`, `plotext/_utility.py`:** Additional helpers for monitoring, shell tab completion, build processes, and general utilities.
- **`plotext/__init__.py`:** Initializes the package and exposes the main plotting API.

#### 2. `data` Directory

The `data` folder contains sample data files:

- **`data/data.txt`**
- **`data/bar_data.txt`**

These files provide example datasets that can be used to test and demonstrate the plotting capabilities of the library.

#### 3. Project Root

- **`setup.py`:** Standard Python setup script for installing the package and managing dependencies.

### Example Usage

After installing the package, you can quickly generate a plot from the terminal using the CLI:

```bash
python -m plotext --file data/data.txt --type line
```

Or, from within Python:

```python
import plotext as plt

# Load data from a file or define it directly
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 15, 13, 17, 20]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sample Line Plot")
plt.show()
```

### Practical Applications

- **Data Exploration:** Quickly visualize data sets in environments without a graphical interface (e.g., SSH sessions, remote servers).
- **Scripting:** Integrate terminal plots into automation scripts for monitoring or reporting.
- **Education:** Use sample data and simple commands to teach data visualization concepts in a text-only environment.

---

This project is ideal for users who need lightweight, dependency-free plotting capabilities directly in the terminal, making data visualization accessible in any environment.

This structure ensures a clear separation between data, core logic, utilities, and user interfaces, making the project easy to navigate and extend.

## Dependencies

## Dependencies

This project relies on a combination of standard Python libraries and a few external packages to provide its full functionality. Below is a detailed breakdown of the dependencies, categorized by type and usage, based on the actual imports found in the codebase.

### Standard Library Dependencies

The following Python standard library modules are used throughout the codebase:

- **math**: Used for mathematical operations in modules such as `_build.py`, `_global.py`, and `_utility.py`.
- **datetime**: Utilized in `_date.py` for date and time manipulations.
- **copy**: Used in `_doc_utils.py` and `_monitor.py` for object copying.
- **re**: Regular expressions are handled in `_doc_utils.py` and `_utility.py`.
- **inspect**: Used in `_doc_utils.py` and `_utility.py` for introspection and documentation utilities.
- **shutil**: Used in `_utility.py` for high-level file operations.
- **os**: Used in `_utility.py` and `plotext_cli.py` for interacting with the operating system.
- **argparse**: Used in `_shtab.py` and `plotext_cli.py` for command-line argument parsing.
- **pathlib**: Used in `setup.py` for filesystem path manipulations.

### Internal Module Dependencies

The codebase is modular, with many internal dependencies to maintain separation of concerns and reusability:

- **plotext._utility**: A utility module imported across several files for shared helper functions.
- **plotext._doc_utils**: Provides documentation utilities, used in `_core.py`, `_doc.py`, and `_figure.py`.
- **plotext._doc**: Documentation-related functions, imported in `_core.py`.
- **plotext._global**: Global variables and settings, used in `_core.py` and `_global.py`.
- **plotext._figure**: Core plotting logic, used in `_global.py`.
- **plotext._date**: Date handling utilities, used in `_figure.py`.
- **plotext._matrix**: Matrix operations, used in `_figure.py` and `_monitor.py`.
- **plotext._monitor**: Monitoring and updating logic, used in `_figure.py` and `_monitor.py`.
- **plotext._default**: Default settings, used in `_figure.py` and `_monitor.py`.
- **plotext._build**: Build utilities, used in `_monitor.py`.
- **_core**, **_figure**, **_doc_utils**: Internal modules referenced directly in some files for core functionality.

### External Dependencies

The following third-party packages are required:

- **setuptools**: Used in `setup.py` for packaging and installation.
- **shtab**: Used in `plotext_cli.py` for shell tab completion support.

> **Note:** The main plotting functionality appears to be self-contained within the `plotext` package and its submodules, minimizing reliance on external plotting libraries.

### Practical Example: CLI Dependencies

The command-line interface (`plotext_cli.py`) demonstrates how dependencies are combined in practice:

```python
import argparse           # For parsing CLI arguments
import shtab              # For shell tab completion
import os                 # For file and environment operations
import plotext            # Main plotting library
import plotext._utility   # Internal utility functions
```

### Installation of External Dependencies

To ensure all required external dependencies are installed, use:

```bash
pip install setuptools shtab
```

If you are installing via `setup.py` or a provided requirements file, these dependencies should be handled automatically.

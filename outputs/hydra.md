## General Information

# General Information

This repository provides a robust framework for building, testing, and extending Python applications, with a particular focus on configuration management, reproducible builds, and extensibility through plugins and examples. The codebase is organized to support both core development and community contributions, offering a variety of helpers, plugins, and real-world usage examples.

## Key Features

- **Modular Build Helpers:**  
  The `build_helpers` package contains utilities and helpers for building and testing Python projects, including reusable scripts and test files.

- **Plugin Architecture:**  
  The `contrib` directory demonstrates how to extend the core functionality with plugins, such as the `hydra_torchrun_launcher`, which integrates distributed launching capabilities.

- **Comprehensive Examples:**  
  The `examples` directory is rich with advanced and practical use cases, including:
  - Ad hoc configuration composition
  - Custom configuration search paths
  - Defaults list interpolation
  - Nested configuration defaults
  - Package overrides
  - Integration with Ray for distributed computing
  - Custom help and logging configurations

- **Configuration-Driven Design:**  
  Many examples and plugins leverage YAML-based configuration files, enabling flexible and reproducible experiment setups.

- **Community and Contribution Friendly:**  
  The repository includes clear guidelines for contributing (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), a code of conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`), and attribution documentation.

## Practical Example

A typical advanced example can be found in `examples/advanced/ad_hoc_composition`, which demonstrates how to compose configurations from multiple sources:

```python
# examples/advanced/ad_hoc_composition/hydra_compose_example.py

import hydra
from omegaconf import DictConfig

@hydra.main(config_path="conf", config_name="config")
def my_app(cfg: DictConfig):
    print(cfg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_app()
```

Configuration files for this example are organized under `conf/`, with subdirectories for databases (`db/`), schemas (`schema/`), and UI (`ui/`). This structure allows for modular and scalable configuration management.

## Technical Highlights

You can run the example script and experiment with different configuration combinations by modifying or selecting different YAML files.

### Practical Example: Contributed Plugin

To see a contributed Hydra plugin in action:

1. **Navigate to**: `contrib/hydra_torchrun_launcher/`
2. **Implementation**: `hydra_plugins/hydra_torchrun_launcher/`
   - Main logic in `distributed_launcher.py`
   - Configuration in `config.py`
3. **Tests**: `tests/test_torchrun_launcher.py`

You can install and test this plugin independently using its `setup.py`.

This modular structure makes it easy to find core utilities, contributed extensions, and a wide variety of practical examples. For more details on each component, refer to the respective README files or explore the directories directly.

## Dependencies

## Dependencies

This project relies on several key dependencies, both for its core functionality and for its plugins, examples, and testing infrastructure. Below is a detailed overview of the main dependencies identified in the codebase, along with practical notes on their usage and integration.

### Core Dependency

- **setuptools**
  - **Purpose:** Used extensively throughout the project for packaging and distribution.
  - **Where Used:**  
    - The main `setup.py` in the project root.
    - All plugin packages (e.g., `plugins/hydra_submitit_launcher/setup.py`, `plugins/hydra_rq_launcher/setup.py`, etc.).
    - Example plugins and advanced examples (e.g., `examples/plugins/example_sweeper_plugin/setup.py`).
    - Test applications and standalone app setups.
    - Build helpers (`build_helpers/__init__.py`).
  - **Practical Example:**  
    Each plugin and example package includes a `setup.py` file that imports and utilizes `setuptools` to define package metadata and entry points.  
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages

    setup(
        name="hydra_example_plugin",
        version="0.1.0",
        packages=find_packages(),
        entry_points={
            # plugin entry points
        },
    )
    ```

### Standard Library Dependencies

- **logging**
  - **Purpose:** Provides robust logging capabilities across the core project, plugins, and test suites.
  - **Where Used:**  
    - Core tools (e.g., `tools/release/release.py`, `tools/configen/configen/configen.py`).
    - Test scripts and test applications (e.g., `tests/test_hydra.py`, `tests/test_apps/*/my_app.py`).
    - All major plugins (e.g., `hydra_submitit_launcher`, `hydra_rq_launcher`, `hydra_ray_launcher`, `hydra_optuna_sweeper`, `hydra_nevergrad_sweeper`, `hydra_joblib_launcher`).
    - Example applications within plugins.
  - **Practical Example:**  
    Logging is initialized in each application and plugin to provide runtime diagnostics and debugging information.
    ```python
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.info("Plugin initialized successfully.")
    ```

- **codecs**
  - **Purpose:** Used for file encoding/decoding operations, primarily in build helper scripts.
  - **Where Used:**  
    - `build_helpers/build_helpers.py`
  - **Practical Example:**  
    Reading files with specific encodings during the build or packaging process.
    ```python
    import codecs

    with codecs.open('README.md', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        long_description = f.read()
    ```

### Dependency Summary Table

| Dependency   | Type             | Used In (Examples)                                         | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| setuptools   | Packaging Tool   | `setup.py`, plugins, examples, build helpers               | Packaging, distribution, entry points   |
| logging      | Standard Library | Core tools, plugins, tests, examples                       | Logging, diagnostics, debugging         |
| codecs       | Standard Library | Build helpers                                              | File encoding/decoding                  |

### Notes on Additional Dependencies

- **Third-Party Libraries:**  
  The codebase data provided does not indicate usage of third-party libraries beyond `setuptools`. However, individual plugins or examples may declare additional dependencies in their respective `setup.py` files. Please refer to each plugin's `setup.py` for a complete list of requirements.

- **Plugin Isolation:**  
  Each plugin is packaged independently, allowing for modular installation and dependency management. This design enables users to install only the plugins they need, reducing unnecessary dependencies.

### How to Install Dependencies

To install the core dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install setuptools
```
For plugin-specific dependencies, navigate to the plugin directory and run:
```bash
pip install .
```
This will install all dependencies declared in that plugin's `setup.py`.

---

**Tip:**  
For development or testing, consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with system packages.

---

For a full list of dependencies and their versions, consult the `setup.py` files in the root directory and each plugin or example package.

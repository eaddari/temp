  Supports a wide variety of plot types, including line, bar, scatter, pie, polar, 3D, statistical, and specialty plots.
- **Gallery of Examples:**  
  Rich set of categorized example scripts and tutorials, demonstrating practical usage and advanced features.
- **Customizability:**  
  Highly configurable through styles, themes, and direct manipulation of plot elements.
- **Backend Flexibility:**  
  Multiple rendering backends (e.g., Agg, SVG, PDF, Tk, Qt, GTK, WX, WebAgg) for compatibility with different environments and output formats.
- **Interactive Widgets and GUIs:**  
  Built-in support for interactive widgets and integration with various GUI toolkits.
- **Documentation and Developer Tools:**  
  Sphinx-based documentation, embedded plot scripts, and developer guides to facilitate learning and contribution.

### Codebase Structure Highlights

- **Core Library (`lib/matplotlib/`):**  
  Contains the main plotting logic, including modules for axes, figures, artists, backends, widgets, scales, colors, and more.  
  Example:  
  ```python
  # lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
  plt.show()
  ```

- **Backends (`lib/matplotlib/backends/`):**  
  Implements rendering engines for different platforms and output formats, such as Qt, Tk, GTK, WX, SVG, PDF, and WebAgg.  
  Example:  
  - `backend_qt5agg.py` for Qt5 GUI integration  
  - `backend_svg.py` for SVG output

- **Axes and Projections (`lib/matplotlib/axes/`, `lib/matplotlib/projections/`):**  
  Provides specialized axes types and projection support (e.g., 3D, polar).

- **Widgets and Interactivity (`lib/matplotlib/widgets.py`):**  
  Interactive controls such as sliders, buttons, and selectors for building dynamic visualizations.

- **Examples and Galleries (`galleries/examples/`, `galleries/plot_types/`, `galleries/tutorials/`):**  
  Organized collections of example scripts covering:
  - Basic plots (lines, bars, scatter, etc.)
  - Advanced topics (animation, event handling, 3D plotting)
  - Specialized domains (statistics, color, text, axes manipulation)
  - User interface integration and widget usage

  Example:
  ```python
  # galleries/examples/animation/simple_anim.py
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import matplotlib.animation as animation
  # ... animation code ...
  ```

- **Documentation (`doc/`):**  
  Sphinx configuration, developer guides, and embedded plot scripts for generating and maintaining documentation.

### Practical Usage Examples

- **Basic Plotting:**
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 4])
  plt.xlabel("x")
  plt.ylabel("y")
  plt.title("Simple Line Plot")
  plt.show()
  ```

- **3D Plotting:**
  ```python
  from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  fig = plt.figure()
  ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
  ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9])
  plt.show()
  ```

- **Interactive Widgets:**
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  from matplotlib.widgets import Slider
  # ... create plot and add slider ...
  ```

- **Customizing Styles:**
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.style.use('ggplot')
  # ... plotting code ...
  ```

### Extensibility and Customization

  Developers can implement new rendering backends by following the backend API in `lib/matplotlib/backends/`.
- **New Plot Types:**  
  Extend plotting capabilities by adding new modules under `lib/matplotlib/` or contributing to the example galleries.
- **Integration with GUIs:**  
  Example scripts in `galleries/examples/user_interfaces/` demonstrate embedding plots in applications using Tk, Qt, GTK, WX, and web frameworks.

### Documentation and Learning Resources

## Dependencies

## Dependencies

This project relies on several external libraries to provide core functionality, with **NumPy** being a primary dependency throughout the codebase. Below is a detailed overview of the dependencies, their roles, and practical examples of how they are used within the project.

### Primary Dependency

#### [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

**Usage in the Codebase:**
NumPy is extensively used across the project for numerical operations, data manipulation, and mathematical computations. Its usage spans core modules, toolkit extensions, and test suites.

**Examples from the Codebase:**

- **3D Plotting and Projections:**  
  Files in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/` such as `proj3d.py`, `axes3d.py`, and `art3d.py` use NumPy for vector and matrix operations essential for 3D transformations and rendering.

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Creating a 3D rotation matrix
  theta = np.radians(45)
  rotation_matrix = np.array([
      [np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta), 0],
      [np.sin(theta),  np.cos(theta), 0],
      [0,              0,             1]
  ])
  ```

- **Triangulation and Mesh Processing:**  
  The `lib/matplotlib/tri/` modules (`_triangulation.py`, `_triplot.py`, etc.) use NumPy for efficient handling of mesh data, interpolation, and triangulation algorithms.

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Creating a mesh grid for triangulation
  x = np.linspace(0, 1, 10)
  y = np.linspace(0, 1, 10)
  X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
  ```

- **Axis and Grid Management:**  
  The `lib/mpl_toolkits/axisartist/` modules utilize NumPy for calculations related to custom axes, grid helpers, and floating axes.

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Calculating tick positions
  ticks = np.arange(0, 10, 0.5)
  ```

- **Testing and Validation:**  
  Numerous test files (e.g., `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_triangulation.py`, `test_transforms.py`, `test_table.py`) use NumPy to generate test data and validate numerical outputs.

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Generating random test data
  data = np.random.rand(100)
  ```

### Additional Dependencies

While NumPy is the most prominent external dependency, the project may also rely on other standard scientific Python libraries (such as Matplotlib itself, which is the core of this codebase). However, based on the provided codebase data, **NumPy** is the only explicitly imported third-party library across a wide range of modules.

### Dependency Management

To ensure all dependencies are installed, it is recommended to use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

If you are setting up a development environment or running tests, ensure that NumPy is included in your environment. For a complete list of dependencies (including optional or development dependencies), refer to the `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file if available.

---

**Summary:**  
NumPy is a critical dependency for this project, enabling efficient numerical computations across plotting, 3D rendering, mesh processing, and testing. Its integration is foundational to the functionality and performance of the codebase.

   export function capitalize(str) {
     if (!str) return '';
     return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
   }
   ```

2. Add a test in `src/utils/__tests__/capitalize.test.js`:
   ```js
   import { capitalize } from '../capitalize';

   test('capitalizes the first letter', () => {
     expect(capitalize('hello')).toBe('Hello');
   });
   ```

3. Run tests and ensure they pass.

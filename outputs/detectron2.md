## Dependencies

## Dependencies

This project relies on several external libraries to provide core functionality, efficient computation, and robust testing. The primary dependency, as evidenced throughout the codebase, is **NumPy**. Below is a detailed overview of the dependencies, their roles, and practical usage examples drawn directly from the codebase.

### Core Dependency

#### [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

**NumPy** is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

**Usage in the Codebase:**

NumPy is extensively used across the project for:

- Array and matrix operations (e.g., manipulating image data, bounding boxes, masks)
- Mathematical computations (e.g., IoU calculations, loss functions)
- Data transformations and augmentations
- Efficient numerical processing in both core modules and test suites

**Examples from the Codebase:**

- **Image and Mask Processing:**  
  In modules like `detectron2/utils/visualizer.py` and `projects/PointRend/point_rend/mask_head.py`, NumPy is used to manipulate image arrays and generate segmentation masks.
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Creating a binary mask
  mask = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=np.uint8)
  mask[polygon_y, polygon_x] = 1
  ```

- **Bounding Box Operations:**  
  In tracking and evaluation modules such as `tests/tracking/test_bbox_iou_tracker.py`, NumPy is used for vectorized IoU calculations and bounding box manipulations.
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Compute IoU between two sets of boxes
  ious = compute_iou(np.array(boxes1), np.array(boxes2))
  ```

- **Data Augmentation and Transformation:**  
  In data processing scripts like `projects/PointSup/point_sup/dataset_mapper.py`, NumPy is used for random sampling, shuffling, and geometric transformations.
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Randomly shuffle dataset indices
  indices = np.arange(len(dataset))
  np.random.shuffle(indices)
  ```

- **Testing and Validation:**  
  The test suite (`tests/`) makes extensive use of NumPy for generating synthetic data, asserting numerical correctness, and validating model outputs.
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example: Generate random test data
  test_input = np.random.rand(10, 3, 224, 224)
  ```

### Additional Dependencies

While NumPy is the most prominent dependency, the project may also require other libraries (such as PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.) for full functionality. Please refer to the [Installation](#installation) section or the `requirements.txt` file for a complete list of dependencies.

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or, for NumPy specifically:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Summary Table

| Library | Purpose | Example Usage Locations |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| **NumPy** | Array operations, numerical computation, data processing | `detectron2/utils/visualizer.py`, `projects/PointSup/point_sup/dataset_mapper.py`, `tests/layers/test_nms_rotated.py`, ... |

---

**Note:**  
NumPy is a critical dependency and is required for almost every module in this project, including core algorithms, data processing, and testing. Ensure it is installed and up-to-date for optimal performance and compatibility.

### Pull Requests

We encourage pull requests!  
However, for significant features (e.g., changes > 50 lines), **please discuss your motivation and proposal with the maintainers in an issue before submitting a PR**. This helps ensure your work aligns with the project's direction and saves you time.

#### PR Guidelines

When submitting a PR, please:

1. **Split Orthogonal Changes:**  
   If your PR contains multiple unrelated changes, split them into separate PRs.
2. **Add Tests:**  
   If you add code that should be tested, include appropriate tests.
3. **Provide Experiment Results:**  
   For PRs involving experiments (e.g., new models or methods), you don't need to update the model zoo, but please provide experiment results in the PR description.
4. **Update Documentation:**  
   If you change APIs, update the relevant documentation.
5. **Use Google Style Docstrings:**  
   Follow the [Google style docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) for Python code.
6. **Lint Your Code:**  
   Ensure your code passes linting with:
   ```bash
   ./dev/linter.sh
   ```

#### Example: Submitting a Model Implementation

Suppose you want to contribute a new model:

- **Open an Issue:** Describe your motivation and approach.
- **Fork and Implement:** Add your model code, following the codebase's structure and style.
- **Add Tests:** Include unit tests for your model.
- **Document:** Add docstrings and update documentation if needed.
- **Experiment Results:** Run experiments and include results in your PR description.
- **Lint:** Run `./dev/linter.sh` before submitting.
